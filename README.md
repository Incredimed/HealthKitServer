HealthKitServer is a REST-based server that stores data from Apple's HealthKit functionality. 

The project includes the server itself and a iOS app written with [Xamarin Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms).

### Datastorage

The server will let you choose from storage to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Solr, Redis or simply in memory.
