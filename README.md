HealthKitServer
===
HealthKitServer is a REST-based server that stores data from Apple's HealthKit functionality. 

The project includes the server itself written in .NET (compiled with Mono for cross-platform support) and an iOS app written with [Xamarin Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms).

### Datastorage

The server will let you choose from storage to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Solr, Redis or simply in memory.
